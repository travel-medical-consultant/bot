                            Dear participant, <br/><br/>
                            Thank you for participating in this study. This study is part of a coursework for the course
                            Collaborative Development of Conversational Agents organized by four German Universities, namely Karlsruher Institut für Technologie, Technische Universität Dresden,
                            Universität des Saarlandes and Universität Hamburg. 
                            <br/> <br/>
                            The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference in the impact of chatbots with and without human-like features on users.
                            The study takes about 20 minutes and consists of three parts. During the whole process, you do not have the possibility to go back to the previous
                            part. Once you click “Next”, you will be forwarded to the next section and cannot go back. We recommend to use a laptop for this survey.
                            As the learning material contains complex English terms and explanations, you need to have at least a B2 English level to take part.                            
                          </p>
